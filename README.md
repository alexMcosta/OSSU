# My [OSSU](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) curriculum notes and projects
####This will be where I keep directories of my OSSU curriculums notes and smaller projects that do not deserve their own repositories.

Having went to school for a a year for computer science I left school to go the rout of self taught and a bootcamp do to my thoughts of school being too expensive and student loans being horrible. Bootcamps taught me pcoding and I plan for OSSU to teach me more of the theory.
