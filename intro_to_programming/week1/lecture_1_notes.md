# Lecture 1 - Introduction to Computation

##Basics of Computation

### Why do we need to go beyond the primitive aspects of a computer?
Computers are fast but we need algorithms that can make a computer work smarter.

~Look up more about Turing's Halting Problem~

>An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.

## Types of Knowledge

### Declarative Knowledge
Declarative knowledge are statements of fact that give "truth"

### Imperative Knowledge
"How to" kind of knowledge

Algorithms are recipes.

## Basic Machine Architecture

### Fixed Program Computers
Are computers that so one thing such as a calculator, Turing's Bombe, etc.

### Stored Program computers
* Are computers like PCs and Macs
* Can store and Manipulate a sequence of instructions
* The sequences are a predefined set of primitives (Arithmetic, simple tests, moving data)
* Runs the interpreter (Special program that runs the primitives in order)

>Turing showed that using six primitives can compute anything<

*Look up Turing complete*

## Programming Language Characteristics
1. Provide a set of primitive operations
2. Provides mechanisms or means for combining primitives to form more complex expressions
3. Provides mechanisms or means for assigning a meaning of value to each computation or expression

### Aspects of languages
*  Primitive constructs
*  Syntax (Determines whether a string is legal)
*  Static semantics (Determines whether a string has meaning)
*  Semantics (Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence)
