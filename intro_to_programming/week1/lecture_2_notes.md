# Lecture 2 - Core Elements of Programs

## Types of Programming languages

### Low Level languages
Source code -> Checker -> Interpreter -> Output
basically at the level of the machine.

### High Level languages

#### Compiled Languages
Source code -> checker -> Compiler -> Object code -> Interpreter -> Output
Lets you have the computer think at a higher level of abstractions
the language you program then gets compiled to a lower a lower language.

#### Interpreted Languages
Source code -> Checker -> Interpreter -> Output
Is the same as a high level language in regards to allowing you to think of
higher level abstractions however it does not compile all at once. Instead, it converts source code into internal data structure, then the interpreter then in a sequence converts to a lower level language.

### Benefits / trade-offs
* Compiled languages are typically faster since you compile the languages at once. However, bugs are harder to find since everything happens at once
* Interpreted languages are usually slower since tasks are interpreted individually however since these tasks are interpreted individually it is easier to spot the errors.
